"""
Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently
depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming 
language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of
these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.

The implementation of Python List is similar to Vectors in C++ or ArrayList in JAVA.

The costly operation is inserting or deleting the element from the beginning of the List
as all the elements are needed to be shifted. Insertion and deletion at the end of the list
can also become costly in the case where the preallocated memory becomes full.
