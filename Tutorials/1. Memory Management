Python handles memory management automatically through a system called garbage collection. Here's an overview of how it works:

### 1. **Memory Allocation**

When you create objects in Python, the interpreter allocates memory for these objects. Python uses a private heap for this purpose, and the programmer doesn’t have direct access to it. Instead, memory is managed internally by the Python memory manager.

### 2. **Reference Counting**

Python primarily uses reference counting to keep track of how many references exist for each object. Each object in Python has a reference count, which is incremented when a new reference is made to the object and decremented when a reference is deleted.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]  # The reference count for the list object [1, 2, 3] is 1
b = a           # The reference count for the list object [1, 2, 3] is now 2
del a           # The reference count for the list object [1, 2, 3] is now 1
del b           # The reference count for the list object [1, 2, 3] is now 0, and the object is deallocated
```

### 3. **Garbage Collection**

Reference counting alone can’t handle all cases, especially circular references (where two or more objects reference each other). To manage this, Python also uses a garbage collector.

- **Generational Garbage Collection:** Python’s garbage collector uses a generational approach. It divides objects into three generations based on how long they have been in memory. New objects start in the first generation. If they survive a garbage collection cycle, they move to the next generation. This approach is based on the observation that older objects are less likely to be garbage collected.

- **Cycle Detection:** The garbage collector detects and breaks reference cycles (groups of objects that reference each other but are not accessible from any other part of the program).

### 4. **Memory Pools**

Python’s memory manager uses memory pools to optimize memory allocation and deallocation. Small objects are managed in pools of fixed sizes to reduce the overhead of allocating and deallocating memory. This is handled by a system called the "object allocator," which is part of Python’s memory manager.

### 5. **Custom Memory Allocators**

Python allows you to define custom memory allocators if needed, but this is an advanced feature and is generally not required for most applications.

### 6. **Managing Memory Usage**

To monitor and manage memory usage in Python, you can use several tools:

- **`gc` Module:** The `gc` module provides functions to interact with the garbage collector. You can use it to disable the garbage collector, manually run garbage collection, and inspect collected objects.
  
  ```python
  import gc
  
  # Force a garbage collection
  gc.collect()
  
  # Check which objects are currently being tracked
  print(gc.get_stats())
  ```

- **Memory Profiling Tools:** Libraries like `memory_profiler` and `tracemalloc` can be used to profile memory usage and identify memory leaks or inefficient memory usage patterns.

### Summary

Python's memory management is designed to handle most common cases automatically, using a combination of reference counting and garbage collection. For most developers, understanding the basics of these mechanisms is sufficient, but tools and techniques are available for more advanced memory management needs.
