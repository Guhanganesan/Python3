In Python, looping statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on certain conditions. Python provides several constructs for looping, including `for` loops, `while` loops, and loop control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `else`. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of each:

### 1. **`for` Loop**

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

#### Basic Syntax

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code block to execute
```

#### Examples

- **Looping through a list:**

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Output:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

- **Looping through a range of numbers:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

- **Looping through a string:**

```python
for char in "hello":
    print(char)
```

Output:
```
h
e
l
l
o
```

- **Using `enumerate()` to get index and value:**

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

for index, color in enumerate(colors):
    print(f"Index {index} has color {color}")
```

Output:
```
Index 0 has color red
Index 1 has color green
Index 2 has color blue
```

### 2. **`while` Loop**

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

#### Basic Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # Code block to execute
```

#### Examples

- **Basic `while` loop:**

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

- **Using `break` to exit the loop:**

```python
count = 0

while True:
    if count == 5:
        break
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

- **Using `continue` to skip an iteration:**

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
        continue
    print(count)
```

Output:
```
1
2
4
5
```

### 3. **Loop Control Statements**

Python provides control statements to modify the flow of loops.

- **`break`**: Exits the current loop and moves to the code following the loop.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and proceeds with the next iteration.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

- **`else` in Loops**: The `else` block after a loop executes if the loop completes without encountering a `break` statement.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed successfully")
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
Loop completed successfully
```

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
else:
    print("Loop completed successfully")
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
```

### Summary

- **`for` Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or a range of numbers.
- **`while` Loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- **`break`**: Exits the loop prematurely.
- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and continues with the next iteration.
- **`else`**: Executes a block of code after the loop if it completes normally without a `break`.

Loops are fundamental for performing repetitive tasks and processing sequences in Python. Understanding how to use them effectively can help in writing efficient and concise code.
