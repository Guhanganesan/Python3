File handling in Python allows you to work with files on your system, including reading from and writing to them. Python provides built-in functions and methods to handle file operations effectively.

### Basic File Operations

Here’s an overview of basic file handling operations in Python:

1. **Opening a File**
2. **Reading from a File**
3. **Writing to a File**
4. **Closing a File**
5. **Working with File Paths**
6. **Handling Exceptions**

### 1. Opening a File

You can open a file using the `open()` function. It takes the file path and mode as arguments. The mode specifies the operation you want to perform on the file.

- `'r'`: Read (default mode, file must exist)
- `'w'`: Write (creates a new file or overwrites an existing file)
- `'a'`: Append (writes data to the end of the file)
- `'b'`: Binary mode (for binary files, e.g., `'rb'` or `'wb'`)
- `'x'`: Exclusive creation (fails if the file already exists)

```python
# Open a file for reading
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

# Open a file for writing
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
```

### 2. Reading from a File

You can read the contents of a file using methods such as `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.

```python
# Read the entire content of the file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Read one line at a time
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    line = file.readline()
    while line:
        print(line, end='')
        line = file.readline()

# Read all lines into a list
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line, end='')
```

### 3. Writing to a File

You can write to a file using methods such as `write()` and `writelines()`.

```python
# Write text to a file (overwrites if file exists)
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")

# Append text to a file
with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("\nAppending another line.")
```

### 4. Closing a File

Always close a file when you’re done with it to free up system resources. The `with` statement automatically closes the file when the block is exited.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
file.close()
```

Using the `with` statement is preferred as it ensures the file is properly closed even if an error occurs.

### 5. Working with File Paths

You can work with file paths using the `os` and `pathlib` modules.

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Get the current working directory
cwd = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current directory: {cwd}")

# Join paths
file_path = os.path.join(cwd, 'example.txt')

# Check if a file exists
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    print("File exists")

# Using pathlib
path = Path('example.txt')
if path.exists():
    print("File exists using pathlib")
```

### 6. Handling Exceptions

Use exception handling to manage errors that may occur during file operations.

```python
try:
    with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"An I/O error occurred: {e}")
```

### Example: File Handling Workflow

Here's a complete example demonstrating file reading, writing, and exception handling:

```python
# Writing to a file
try:
    with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write("Hello, world!\n")
        file.write("This is a file handling example.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while writing to the file: {e}")

# Reading from a file
try:
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("File content:")
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while reading the file: {e}")
```

### Summary

- **Opening a File**: Use `open(filename, mode)` to open a file.
- **Reading from a File**: Use `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()` to read file content.
- **Writing to a File**: Use `write()` or `writelines()` to write data to a file.
- **Closing a File**: Always close the file using `file.close()` or use a `with` statement for automatic closure.
- **Working with File Paths**: Use `os` and `pathlib` for file path operations.
- **Handling Exceptions**: Use `try` and `except` to handle errors during file operations.

Proper file handling ensures that your programs can read and write files efficiently and handle errors gracefully.
