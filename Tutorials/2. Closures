In Python, a closure is a programming concept where a nested function retains access to variables from its enclosing scope even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are a powerful feature that can be used to create data encapsulation and function factories.

### How Closures Work

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how closures work:

1. **Nested Function Definition**: You define a function inside another function.
2. **Access to Enclosing Scope**: The inner function accesses variables from its enclosing (outer) function.
3. **Return Inner Function**: The outer function returns the inner function.
4. **Retention of State**: Even after the outer function has finished execution, the inner function retains access to the variables from the outer functionâ€™s scope.

### Example

Here's a simple example to illustrate closures:

```python
def outer_function(x):
    def inner_function(y):
        return x + y
    return inner_function

# Create a closure
closure = outer_function(10)

# Call the closure with a new argument
result = closure(5)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

### Explanation:

1. **Definition of `outer_function(x)`**: Defines a function that takes `x` and returns `inner_function`.
2. **Definition of `inner_function(y)`**: Defines a nested function that takes `y` and returns `x + y`.
3. **Returning `inner_function`**: `outer_function` returns `inner_function`, which is now a closure because it retains access to `x` from its enclosing scope.
4. **Calling `closure(5)`**: When you call `closure` (which is essentially `inner_function` with `x` set to `10`), it has access to `x` and adds `5` to it.

### Use Cases for Closures

- **Function Factories**: Create functions with specific behavior based on their parameters.
- **Encapsulation**: Hide data and implementation details inside functions.
- **State Retention**: Maintain state across function calls.

### Example of a Function Factory

Here's an example of a closure being used as a function factory:

```python
def make_multiplier(factor):
    def multiplier(x):
        return x * factor
    return multiplier

# Create different multiplier functions
double = make_multiplier(2)
triple = make_multiplier(3)

print(double(10))  # Output: 20
print(triple(10))  # Output: 30
```

### Explanation:

- **`make_multiplier(factor)`**: Takes a `factor` and returns a `multiplier` function.
- **`double`** and **`triple`**: Are closures created with different `factor` values. They retain their respective `factor` values and use them to multiply input numbers.

### Important Points

- **Closures retain state**: The inner function retains the environment of its enclosing function, including variables.
- **Memory Usage**: Be mindful of closures as they can hold references to objects, potentially causing increased memory usage if not managed properly.

Closures are a versatile feature in Python that can be used to create powerful and flexible code patterns. They allow for encapsulating behavior and state in a way that can be very useful in various programming scenarios.
