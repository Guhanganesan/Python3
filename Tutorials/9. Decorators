In Python, decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. They are used to wrap functions or methods, allowing you to execute code before and after the wrapped function executes, or even modify its inputs and outputs.

### Basic Concept

A decorator is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument, adds some functionality, and returns a new function with the extended behavior. 

### Syntax

```python
@decorator_function
def some_function():
    pass
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
def some_function():
    pass

some_function = decorator_function(some_function)
```

### Examples

#### 1. **Basic Decorator**

A simple decorator that prints a message before and after calling the original function:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

**Output:**
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator that wraps the `say_hello` function with additional behavior.

#### 2. **Decorator with Arguments**

Decorators can also accept arguments. Hereâ€™s how you can create a decorator that takes parameters:

```python
def repeat(num_times):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(num_times):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@repeat(num_times=3)
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Alice!
```

In this example, the `repeat` decorator takes an argument `num_times` and repeats the execution of the `greet` function.

#### 3. **Decorator with Arguments and Return Value**

A decorator that measures the execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(2)

slow_function()
```

**Output:**
```
slow_function took 2.0000 seconds to execute.
```

In this example, the `timer` decorator measures and prints the execution time of the `slow_function`.

#### 4. **Class Method Decorators**

Decorators can also be used with class methods:

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Static method called.")

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print("Class method called.")

    @property
    def property_method(self):
        return "Property method called."

# Using the methods
MyClass.static_method()
MyClass.class_method()
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.property_method)
```

**Output:**
```
Static method called.
Class method called.
Property method called.
```

In this example:
- `@staticmethod` is used to define a static method.
- `@classmethod` is used to define a class method.
- `@property` is used to define a property method that can be accessed like an attribute.

### Summary

- **Decorators** are functions that modify or extend the behavior of other functions or methods.
- **Basic Syntax**: Use the `@decorator_name` syntax before the function definition.
- **Parameters**: Decorators can take parameters by nesting functions.
- **Use Cases**: Common uses include logging, timing, access control, and memoization.
- **Class Methods**: Decorators can be applied to class methods and properties.

Decorators provide a clean, readable way to augment functionality, making your code more modular and reusable.
